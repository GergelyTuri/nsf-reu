title: About Kally

**Kally Oâ€™Reilly Sparks, PhD** (Child & Adolescent Psychiatry. Field: neurodevelopment, learning and memory, and autism) joined NYSPI in 2018 as a Research Scientist and an Assistant Professor in Clinical Neurobiology at Columbia University. As the Co-Director of the Translational Neurobiology of Development Lab at NYSPI, Dr. Sparks uses chemogenetic manipulations to understand how altered circuit development impacts adult cognitive abilities and how experience shapes the developing rodent brain. Potential student projects in her lab could use mice to focus on 1) how the development of memory systems contribute to adult learning and memory, or 2) how juvenile peer social interactions impact adult neural circuitry and social behavioral outcomes.
